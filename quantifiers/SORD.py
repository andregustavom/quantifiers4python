"""SORD

It quantifies events based on their scores applying the framework DyS with the Sample ORD Dissimilarity (SORD) proposed by Maletzke et al.(2019).

Parameters
----------
test : array
    A numeric vector of scores predicted from the test set.
    
p_score : array
    A numeric vector of positive scores estimated either from a validation set or from a cross-validation method.

n_score : array
    A numeric vector of negative scores estimated either from a validation set or from a cross-validation method.
    
Returns
-------
array
    the class distribution of the test.
